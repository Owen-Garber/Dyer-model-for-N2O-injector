SPI for Dyer
Changed to only calculate for one upstream pressure .
Also changed so that the minimum P_2 ( given by deltaP below ) is 1
bar , to match HEM .
NOTE FOR CO2 : minimum P_2 =5.2 bar
Start from highest deltaP to match HEM as well .

 Furthermore , DeltaP cannot be 0 as this will cause a division by 0
in
the Dyer model â€™s calculation of k, so has been set to stop at 1.
